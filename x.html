Whoâ€™s LDC?
Letâ€™s seeâ€¦. How would I describe myself? â€“ Handsome, no - Gorgeous! Againâ€¦ JUST KIDDING! Iâ€™m DINH CUONG, a desiger - photographer - editor - developer and ... I don't know )) whoâ€™s lucky enough to call Vietnam home. I fill these pages with my life & adventures. 
I'm originally from Thanh Hoa, Vietnam and an alumnus of "Lam Son High School for the Gifted" and "Academy of Cryptography Techniques".
Currenly, I'm an international student in Russia.
I love the internet, technology, music, sports, dogs, cats, children, ... and building beautiful things.
Follow my misadventures as I stay, work, wander, eat, and photograph my way around this world
